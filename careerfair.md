### How it Works
* 11:30-11:50am - Check-in
* 11:50-12:20pm - Info Session Rotation #1
* 12:30-1pm - Info Session Rotation #2
* 1-1:15pm - Break
* 1:15-3pm - 10 minute 1:1s, by appointment only

After checking in via Zoom, students will have the opportunity to attend two info sessions. This will be a time for students to learn more about the company, open roles, and ask any questions. The career fair will conclude with 10-minute 1:1 sessions for students and company representatives to meet. 

Students will be notified of their placements for info sessions and 1:1 sessions 2-3 days before the event. We cannot guarantee every student a 1:1 session, but we will do our best to match students with info sessions based on their stated preferences on the registration form.
