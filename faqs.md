##### Q: Do I need Data Science experience to join the club?

A: No! If you have little to none data science or coding experience, there is a beginner route for newcomers designed to teach the basics and fundamentals needed to be well on your way to becoming a better data scientist.

##### Q: Are there requirements and strict settings within the club?

A: Not in the slightest! After all, this club is ran us; the students! The club is designed to groom and polish data science skills, but it is no way a stressful club to be apart of. Every member and officer are some of the most friendly and compatible people to work with and form friendships with! You will get out of the club what you put in!

##### Q: When are the meetings and how often am I supposed to attend them?

A: Meetings begin every Tuesday night at 7:00 and typically last about two hours. Meetings may not take place during Finals week when schoolwork is overwhelming. You should attend whenever you can, and try to make it to every meeting. Of course, we are all University students at the end of the day, and if you can not make it for this reason, it is totally understandable. If you miss a meeting, contact your project group so you don’t feel out of the loop from week to week.

##### Q: What is the Project Showcase?

A: The Project Showcase is an opportunity for you to show off all you and your project group’s hard work at the end of the year! After working for multiple quarters on a certain project that your group devises, the finished project can be submitted, reviewed, and presented at the Project Showcase.

##### Q: Do I have to be a Computer Science or Statistics major to join the club?

A: Absolutely not! Anybody is welcome in the club that has an interest in learning about Data Science, no matter your major or intended field!

##### Q: Which language will I be using within the club?

A: Typically, our project groups will work in either Python or R predominantly. What language you choose to use is up to you and your project group! Also, if you are familiar with R, and not as strong in Python, or vice versa, and want to learn more of the other language, you have the opportunity to do so through the club!

##### Q: How can I get more involved with the club?

A: Anybody is welcome to join the club, and the best way to get more involved is to attend the weekly general meetings! Also, follow us on our social media platforms and join the UCSB Data Science slack channel to stay updated on upcoming event!
