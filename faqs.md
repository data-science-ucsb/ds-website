##### Q: Do I need Data Science experience to join the club?

A: No! If you have little to no data science or coding experience, there is a beginner route for newcomers designed to teach the basics and fundamentals needed to be well on your way to becoming a better data scientist.

##### Q: Are there requirements and strict settings within the club?

A: Not in the slightest! After all, this club is run by us, the students! The club is designed to groom and polish your data science skills, but it is no way a stressful club to be a part of. Every member and officer is a friendly and compatible person to work with that you can form friendships with. From this club, you will get what you put in!

##### Q: When are the meetings and how often am I supposed to attend them?

A: Meetings begin every Tuesday night at 7:00 and typically last for about two hours. Meetings will not take place during Finals week. You should attend whenever you can, and try to make it to every meeting. If you miss a meeting, it's totally understandable. Just make sure to check in with your project group so you don’t feel out of the loop from week to week, or contact an office or peer to get caught up on what was taught.

##### Q: What is the Project Showcase?

A: The Project Showcase is an opportunity for you to show off you and your project group’s hard work at the end of the year! After working for multiple quarters on a certain project that your group devises, the finished project can be submitted, reviewed, and presented at the Project Showcase.

##### Q: Do I have to be a Computer Science or Statistics major to join the club?

A: Absolutely not! Anybody that has an interest in learning about Data Science is welcome in this club, no matter your major or intended field!

##### Q: Which languages will I be using within the club?

A: Typically, our project groups will be working predominantly in either Python or R. The language you choose to use is up to you and your project group. Also, if you are familiar with R, and not as strong in Python, or vice versa, and want to learn more of the other language, you have the opportunity to do so through this club!

##### Q: How can I get more involved with the club?

A: Anybody is welcome to join the club, and the best way to get more involved is to attend the weekly general meetings! Also, follow us on our social media platforms and join Data Science UCSB's Slack channel to stay updated on upcoming events!

##### Q: What do I need to bring to the meetings?

A: Just bring your computer and your knowledge and you should be good to go!
