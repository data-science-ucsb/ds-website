Our mentorship program is a great way to network with other students in the club and get guidance on your major and career. If you’re interested in joining our program as either a mentor or mentee, please fill out the form below by Tuesday, Oct 13th. Once we receive everyone’s responses, we’ll pair students up and send out their match information. Every mentee will be assigned a mentor, and each pair can determine how frequently they want to meet and what type of guidance the mentee would like to receive. **The only requirement to be a mentor (or a Big Data!!) is to be at least a third-year student (non-transfer) and being a mentee (or a Lil Data!!) is recommended for only first-year, second-year, and transfer students. Our mentorship program is meant to resemble a Big/Little Program with additional academic and career support.** To get things started, our mentorship program kick-off meeting will be on October 16th from 4:30-5:30 pm where you’ll learn more about the program and meet your mentor/mentee!
