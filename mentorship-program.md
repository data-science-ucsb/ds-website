Our mentorship program is a great way to network with other students in the club and get guidance on your major and career. If you're interested in joining our program as either a mentor or mentee, please fill out the form below by Tuesday, Oct 13th. Once we receive everyone's responses, we'll pair students up and send out their match information. Every mentee will be assigned only one mentor, and each pair can determine how frequently they want to meet and what type of guidance the mentee would like to receive. To get things started, our mentorship program kick-off meeting will be on October 16th from 4:30-5:30 pm where you'll learn more about the program and meet your mentor/mentee!
