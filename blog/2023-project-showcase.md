The 2023 Data Science UCSB Project Showcase was a success! To start off the event, our club members presented their data science projects for a chance to win cash prizes from our company sponsors. 

Congratulations to  ViewTube, Correkt, AI Art Detector, Movie Character Matching, Emo-Jeneration/TwitterTwin, Pylot, Blendify, Netflix Recommendation System, SlangSwitch, Species Classification, Noteblockit, Optimizing San Diego MTS, SentimentSub, and Sonic Sort for presenting in the showcase! The projects this year were outstanding. Special shoutout to Optimizing San Diego MTS and SlangSwitch for winning the top prizes!

Following the project presentations, we held a catered lunch and a postering session outside Corwin Pavilion for everyone involved. To finish off the day, we held a networking event for all students and faculty interested in data science.  

We are so thankful for Evidation Health, Jackpocket, Adstra, and Microsoft for sponsoring this event. See you all in the fall!
