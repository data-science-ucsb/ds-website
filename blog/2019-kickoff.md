With both new and old members gathering in the DAHC, attendees were able meet the officers on board, learn about how to get involved, and make connections! Offering a place for people coming in with different skill levels for data science, we introduced what the involvements into the club over the year would be, which includes the beginner, intermediate, and advanced pipeline that we will be leading. Attendees participated in a pitch fire where they collaboratively brainstormed and followingly presented a data science project along with their considerations of the data would be retrieved and its possible applications!
