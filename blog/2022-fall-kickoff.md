The 2022 Fall Kickoff was a major success and the turnout was amazing! It was great to see so many new and old faces alike. We are so excited to resume our club operations for the 2022 - 2023 school year! 

If you're not already registered for the club, make sure to do so using the big blue 'Register' button in the menu bar on the top right. We will be meeting every Tuesday from 7-9 PM. We can't wait to see you there!
