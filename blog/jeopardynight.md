On Friday, January 28th, we held a jeopardy competition for our last Zoom social! Contestants had ten seconds to answer questions about TikTok trends, Fruits & Vegetables, UCSB, Data Science, and General Knowledge. 

Shoutout to Eric Yoon for winning first place and to Jackie Chen and Joseph Chang for winning 1st and 2nd runner ups. The three winners received $15 Amazon gift cards, so make sure to attend our socials for more exciting incentives like these.

We canâ€™t wait to see everyone in-person for our next upcoming social.
