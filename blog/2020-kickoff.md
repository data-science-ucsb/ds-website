Gathering both newcomers and old members, Data Science UCSB's first kickoff meeting of the year is taking place on Tuesday night! We're encouraging those who are interested in learning about data science, collaborating on projects, or just wanting to see what our club is about to join in! From mentorship programs to technical workshops, attendees will learn about how to get access to plenty of events and opportunities lined up for this fall quarter.
