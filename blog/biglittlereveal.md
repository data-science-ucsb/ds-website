On Friday, October 22nd, Data Science UCSB revealed our big data / little data families. This program is a great opportunity for data scientists to either mentor someone or learn from someone with more experience at UCSB. At the reveal, littles and bigs were able to connect with one another at the Student Health Lawn, playing social games to bond with one another. We encourage all big and little datas to keep in regular contact with one another as the quarter progresses. New data families can expect more big/little events to come in the winter quarter. 

Thank you to all of our members that came out this week!
