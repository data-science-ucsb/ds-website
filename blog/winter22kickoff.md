Data Science UCSB will welcome both new and returning members to our first meeting of 2022 this Tuesday, January 4th. The event will take place via [Zoom](https://www.datascienceucsb.org/events-calendar/) from 7-9 pm. If you’re interested in learning how to code in Python, explore machine learning, or work on a collaborative project, we encourage you to attend this event. 

Here are some important notes:

* We have a great lineup of events this quarter,  including big-little activities, workshops, and socials!

* In order to be eligible for the Spring Project Showcase, your team must attend all meetings this quarter. If your team cannot attend, please communicate the absence to Hirish/Connor.

* All club activities are in accordance with UCSB’s COVID policy. We plan to have the first two club meetings remotely and transition to in-person meetings when classes resume on campus. 

We hope to see you there!
