Data Science UCSB welcomed over 350 new and returning members in CHEM 1179 on Tuesday (9/28) for our Fall kickoff meeting. Members learned about the club, data science as a field, and the opportunities we present to our members. 

* With events such as general meetings, data talks, club socials, and professional development opportunities, we offer a wide variety of opportunities to our members. 

* We are offering three pipelines this quarter - the beginner pipeline for those with little to no experience in coding, the intermediate pipeline for those who have some experience and would like to learn machine learning, and the project group for advanced members looking to apply their skills. 

* Please contact any of the officers or contact us through our resources page if you have any academic or professional questions. 


Thank you to all of our members that came out this week!
