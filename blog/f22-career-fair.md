This year, we hosted Data Science UCSB's very first career fair over Zoom. The companies that attended were Invoca, Amazon, Mercury Insurance, Pacific Life, DNV, Toyon, Epic, The Capitol Life, Nalu, Analytic Focus, and Carpe Data.  

Students got to participate in information sessions as well as 1 on 1's with recruiters from each of the companies.  

Our first career fair was successful and we cannot wait to continue hosting more in future years! Thank you to everyone who came out!
