Today we heard from three Pacific Life employees about their experience as an undergraduate and how it has influenced their jobs at Pacific Life. The Pacific Life representatives advised us on the best skills to obtain as a college student, as well as the most applicable classes at UCSB. Their presentation was followed by a Q/A session where Data Science Club members were able to seek professional advice. Our members had some excellent questions and we are so thankful to Pacific Life for being so insightful! It was amazing to see UCSB alumni use their degrees in data science!
