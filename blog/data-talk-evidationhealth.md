On Wednesday, Data Science UCSB hosted a data talk with Evidation health, a local company that specializes in health tracking apps. This was a great opportunity for our members to learn about what it’s really like working in the data science industry.

We had two featured speakers from Evidation Health:

* Benjamin Fox (UCSB alumnus)
* Raul Eulogio (former member of the executive board at DS UCSB)

Ben and Raul shared mentorship tips, daily on-the-job data engineering tasks, and an overview of some of their most recent projects. Our members came out and asked the representatives from Evidation Health questions about the field, the specifics of their job roles, and applicable skills from university.  

Thank you to everyone that came out to this event!
