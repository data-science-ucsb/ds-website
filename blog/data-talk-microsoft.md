Data Science UCSB and IEEE hosted a tech talk with UCSB Alumni and current Microsoft Program Manager, Nick Ray. We were excited to have Nick dive deep into how his team innovates using visual search. Providing insight into the technical and product challenges his team faces, Nick discusses how they were able to develop a new approach to searching for millions of users.
