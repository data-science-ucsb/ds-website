With our first data talk of the fall quarter we hosted Toyon Associates, a “recognized leader in the healthcare reimbursement consulting field with a growing software division.”  Lead by Daniel Pelayo and Arvind Dhananjayan, a UCSB alumni himself, of Toyon Associates, Inc, members were able to learn about their work and how Toyon Associates incorporates data science into the world of healthcare and peek into how such applications benefits this particular industry.
