This Tuesday, Data Science UCSB held a data talk with AppFolio, a local company that specializes in cloud-based business software solutions in the property management market. 

Representatives from the AppFolio Data Science Team discussed their career tips, day-in-the-life, and an overview of their recent projects. We had an excellent turnout of nearly 100 members, and there were so great many questions regarding the field of data science, graduate school, working in property management, applicable skills from university, and more.  

The featured speakers included:

* Micah Brachman (UCSB alum): data scientist specializing in geography
* Randy Short: data scientist in the payments division
* James Morrissey: data scientist in the customer insights division

Thank you to all of our members who came to this event! It was great to see so many people interested in the industry.
