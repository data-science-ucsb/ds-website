For the personal projects workshop, our officer and pro project mentor Connor Levenson walked us through how to get started with a personal project. Personal projects are the best way to get real-world experience with data science and those with project experience are much more highly sought after by employers. 

Connor walked us through the following topics: 

* Why should you have a personal/portfolio project?
* Good practices for setting up your environments
* What does a good project look like?
* Pipeline for a DS project: from the initial idea to the results
<UL>
<LI>Data first approach
<LI>Question first approach
<LI>Assessing feasibility of the project
<LI>Tidying the data
<LI>Data visualization
<LI>Model training and validation
</UL>

* Sample publication of a project


Thank you to all of our members that came out this to this workshop!
