For the personal projects workshop, our officer and pro project mentor Connor Levenson walked us through how to get started with a personal project. Personal projects are the best way to get real-world experience with data science and those with project experience are much more highly sought after by employers. 

Connor walked us through the following topics: 

* Why should you have a personal/portfolio project?
* Good practices for setting up your environments
* What does a good project look like?
* Sample publication of a project

We also reviewed a project pipeline that would take us from the initial idea to the results:
* Data first approach
* Question first approach
* Assessing feasibility of the project
* Tidying the data
* Data visualization
* Model training and validation
* Sample publication of a project

Thank you to all of our members that came out this to this workshop!
