The 2022 Data Science UCSB Project Showcase was a huge success! To start off the event, our club members presented their data science projects for a chance to win cash prizes from our company sponsors. 

Congratulations to Housing Price Prediction, GANime, Pawpularity, Team Disaster, Bone Marrow Classification, BotCoin, InstaBot, Emogen, and Recommeddit for presenting in the showcase! The projects this year were outstanding. Special shoutout to Emogen and Recommeddit for winning the top prizes from Evidation and Jackpocket!

Following the project presentations, we held a catered lunch and a postering session outside Corwin Pavilion for everyone involved. To finish off the day, we held a networking event for all students and faculty interested in data science. 

We are so thankful for Evidation, Jackpocket, Carpe Data, and Amazon Alexa for sponsoring this event. See you all in the fall!
