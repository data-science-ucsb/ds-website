The Project Showcase is our annual event where selected groups get the opportunity to present their project to a panel of judges. This year, our panel comprised of Professor Kate Kharitonova, Professor Sang-Yun Oh, Luca Foschini (CEO of Evidation Health), and Victor Borda (Chief Data Scienctist at Invoca). The Most Innovative project was awarded to Parker Glenn for his Newsfeed Article Clustering, and the Best Overall was awarded to Ludvig Killingberg, Maya Samet, Shakuntala Mitra, and Zahra Afzal for their Blood Cell Classification & Detection project.
