The families for the 2022-23 school year have been revealed! Our Bigs and Littles came together for a fun evening of games and competition with the other families to see who is the BEST data science family!  

We hope these families serve as a way for newer members (both to the Data Science Club and to UCSB) to feel welcomed and more comfortable acclimating!
