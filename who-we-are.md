Data Science at UCSB is the university's most active engineering and science club on campus. We focus on teaching students the basics of topics in data science such as data visualization, manipulation, predictive modeling, and machine learning. Focusing on R, Python, and SQL, we hope to foster a learning environment for students of all skill levels.

The club is open to students of all grade levels and majors.

| Hey everyone! My name is Krish Agarwal and I am a fourth year Computer Science major from the Bay Area. I enjoy playing Badminton and Volleyball, collecting colognes, and keeping up with anything kpop/kdrama related. I have been a part of the club since my freshman year and I joined to gain real life data science experience outside of the classroom but I have also been able to find a community and make close friends through my time as an officer. | Hi! I’m a fourth-year CS major at UCSB from San Jose. I have a deep passion for all things data science and web development. The way I approach learning and solving problems is diving headfirst: understand the landscape of what you’re trying to learn or create and just do it, learning as you go. When I’m not working on side projects or cramming homework last minute, you can find me improvising on the dorm lounge pianos or running on the beautiful SB beaches! | Hi, I'm Sam, and I'm thrilled to serve as the VP for the upcoming year! Data Science UCSB has been a transformative experience in my college career, igniting my passion for giving back to our community through human-centric approaches that drive valuable impact. I'm excited to meet all the members and collaborate on awesome data-related projects! Feel free to reach out on Discord or Instagram if you'd like to chat! |

My abilities are focused on general knowledge and answering questions to the best of my understanding up until September 2021. It would be inaccurate and potentially misleading to claim that I have personal interests or achievements, as I'm just a | I'm a 2nd year CS major who loves building cool things with computers! I've spent years writing + deploying full-stack web apps and training ML models to fly planes. My interest in data privacy has led me to build and maintain servers for a homelab. I also love teaching and getting others as excited about CS as I do! | I’m a second year Computing (CCS) major from the Bay Area. I’m interested in interdisciplinary applications of data science. More specifically, leveraging machine learning to make valuable and innovative contributions to other disciplines. In my free time, I enjoy baking, painting, and any other creative activities. I’m excited to meet the UCSB Data Science community this year! | I’m a CCS student interested in mathematics. My focus is largely applied math, especially in fields such as statistics, machine learning, and computer science. I have a passion for both learning and teaching, having worked extensively as a tutor, and I plan on applying these skills in applied math research throughout the coming school years. |
