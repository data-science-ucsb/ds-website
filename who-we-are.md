Data Science at UCSB is the university's most active engineering and science club on campus. We focus on teaching students the basics of topics in data science such as data visualization, manipulation, predictive modeling, and machine learning. Focusing on R, Python, and SQL, we hope to foster a learning environment for students of all skill levels.

The club is open to students of all grade levels and majors.

| Hi! I'm a fourth-year Computer Science and Statistics & Data Science double major at UCSB, originally from San Jose, CA. I have been involved with Data Science UCSB since my first year, and it has helped me tremendously with growing my technical skills as well as meeting other students/faculty. In my free time, I enjoy dancing, cooking, and grabbing coffee with friends! |

| Hi!! I’m a second year statistics and data science major who loves to read, bake, and play video games! I am just starting off in the data science pathways so my current main interest is learning how to analyze various graphs that can be generated from a particular set of data.   | Hello! I am a third-year Stats & Data Science and Economics double major from Marin County, CA. In my free time, I’m an active member of UCSB Women’s Club Water Polo, and I love to swim. This year, I hope to make learning data science more accessible to UCSB students and continue the friendly atmosphere of Data Science UCSB.  |
