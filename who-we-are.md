Data Science at UCSB is the university's most active engineering and science club on campus. We focus on teaching students the basics of topics in data science such as data visualization, manipulation, predictive modeling, and machine learning. Focusing on R, Python, and SQL, we hope to foster a learning environment for students of all skill levels.

The club is open to students of all grade levels and majors.

| Hey everyone! My name is Krish Agarwal and I am a fourth year Computer Science major from the Bay Area. I enjoy playing Badminton and Volleyball, collecting colognes, and keeping up with anything kpop/kdrama related. I have been a part of the club since my freshman year and I joined to gain real life data science experience outside of the classroom but I have also been able to find a community and make close friends through my time as an officer. | Hi! I’m a fourth-year CS major at UCSB from San Jose. I have a deep passion for all things data science and web development. The way I approach learning and solving problems is diving headfirst: understand the landscape of what you’re trying to learn or create and just do it, learning as you go. When I’m not working on side projects or cramming homework last minute, you can find me improvising on the dorm lounge pianos or running on the beautiful SB beaches! | Hi, I'm Sam, and I'm thrilled to serve as the VP for the upcoming year! Data Science UCSB has been a transformative experience in my college career, igniting my passion for giving back to our community through human-centric approaches that drive valuable impact. I'm excited to meet all the members and collaborate on awesome data-related projects! Feel free to reach out on Discord or Instagram if you'd like to chat! |

| I'm a 2nd year CS major who loves building cool things with computers! I've spent years writing + deploying full-stack web apps and training ML models to fly planes. My interest in data privacy has led me to build and maintain servers for a homelab. I also love teaching and getting others as excited about CS as I do! | I’m a second year Computing (CCS) major from the Bay Area. I’m interested in interdisciplinary applications of data science. More specifically, leveraging machine learning to make valuable and innovative contributions to other disciplines. In my free time, I enjoy baking, painting, and any other creative activities. I’m excited to meet the UCSB Data Science community this year! | I’m a CCS student interested in mathematics. My focus is largely applied math, especially in fields such as statistics, machine learning, and computer science. I have a passion for both learning and teaching, having worked extensively as a tutor, and I plan on applying these skills in applied math research throughout the coming school years. |

| I am a 1st-year Statistics and Data Science major interested specifically in big data in healthcare. I am excited to learn something new every day about data science during my time here at UCSB and the Data Science Club. I also enjoy data visualization and writing about data, leading me to become interested in data journalism. I hope to become more knowledgeable in my field and hopefully, one day be able to teach others about the fascinating world of data science in near the future! I listen to many genres of music, but my favorite song to chill to is probably From the Start by Laufey! | I’m a first-year CS major who loves learning about how we can use software to help optimize our lives, in every form from personal assistants to government-level data analysis programs. That mission’s led me to the very fun field of machine learning, where I hope to do some great research work. I’m also super interested in the history of computers, the best ways to use them, and being a real nerd about both! | I'm a first year Stats & DS major interested in learning more about the intersection of data analytics and business administration! I hope that my interest in business analytics as well as the experience I will gain as outreach intern will help prepare me for a future career in business I don't have much programming experience, but I am excited to develop some of those skills this year with the club through the various projects that will be offered in the coming quarters. |
