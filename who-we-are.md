Data Science at UCSB is the university's most active engineering and science club on campus. We focus on teaching students the basics of topics in data science such as data visualization, manipulation, predictive modeling, and machine learning. Focusing on R, Python, and SQL, we hope to foster a learning environment for students of all skill levels.

The club is open to students of all grade levels and majors.

| I’m a fourth year Statistics and Data Science major from the Bay Area and a boba connoisseur who loves road trips, reading, and drawing. I joined data science because I love how the field combines both programming and data to improve upon information and communicate that information to the rest of the world. This year, I hope that Data Science UCSB can be a great resource for members to gain hands-on experience for the technical industry and serve as a great community. | I'm a fourth-year Stats & Data Science and Economics double major from Marin County in the Bay Area. In my free time, I’m an active member of UCSB Women’s Club Water Polo and I love to swim. I joined the club to work on data science projects and to build a supportive network. This year, I hope to make learning data science more accessible to UCSB students and continue the friendly atmosphere of the club.  | Hey everyone! My name is Krish Agarwal and I am a third year Computer Science major from the Bay Area. I enjoy playing Badminton and Volleyball, hitting the gym, and watching anime. I have been a part of the club since my freshman year and I joined to gain real life data science experience outside of the classroom but I have also been able to find a community and make close friends through my time as an officer.  |
