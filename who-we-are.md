Data Science at UCSB is the university's most active engineering and science club on campus. We focus on teaching students the basics of topics in data science such as data visualization, manipulation, predictive modeling, and machine learning. Focusing on R, Python, and SQL, we hope to foster a learning environment for students of all skill levels.

The club is open to students of all grade levels and majors.

I am a BS/MS student in Computer Science, and your current acting president of Data Science UCSB. I hope to be able to pass on some of my experience to you all as members of our organization.  | I'm a fourth year Financial Math and Statistics major with an English minor, and I'm from the Bay Area. I love sushi, frisbee, hiking, and creative writing. I'm a member of DS because I like data analytics, specifically using data to answer questions about trends we see in our daily lives.    | I'm currently a third-year Computer Science and Statistics & Data Science double major at UCSB, originally from San Jose, CA. I have been involved with Data Science UCSB since my first year, and it has helped me tremendously with growing my technical skills as well as meeting other students/faculty. In my free time, I enjoy dancing, cooking, and grabbing coffee with friends!!
