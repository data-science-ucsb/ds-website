Data Science at UCSB is the university's most active engineering and science club on campus. We focus on teaching students the basics of topics in data science such as data visualization, manipulation, predictive modeling, and machine learning. Focusing on R, Python, and SQL, we hope to foster a learning environment for students of all skill levels.

The club is open to students of all grade levels and majors.

| I’m a third year Statistics and Data Science major from the Bay Area and a boba connoisseur who loves road trips and exploring new hobbies, reading, and drawing. I joined data science because I love how the field combines both programming and data to improve upon information and communicate that information to the rest of the world. | I'm a fourth-year Stats & Data Science and Economics double major from Marin County in the Bay Area. In my free time, I’m an active member of UCSB Women’s Club Water Polo and I love to swim. I joined the club to work on data science projects and to build a supportive network. This year, I hope to make learning data science more accessible to UCSB students and continue the friendly atmosphere of the club.  | Hey everyone! My name is Krish Agarwal and I am a third year Computer Science major from the Bay Area. I enjoy playing Badminton and Volleyball, hitting the gym, and watching anime. I have been a part of the club since my freshman year and I joined to gain real life data science experience outside of the classroom but I have also been able to find a community and make close friends through my time as an officer.  |

| Hi! I’m a third year Statistics and Data Science major from Orange County. I love data analysis, especially when I get to use datasets that relate to biology or environmental science! I love baking, reading, and playing video games. I’m excited to get to know so many new people in this club this year! | Bio | Hey guys! I'm a fourth year Financial Math and Stats major originally from Orange County. I joined Data Science UCSB because I wanted to further develop my data science skills outside of the courses allocated for my major. I enjoy reading, going to the beach, and playing the piano in my free time! |

| Bio  | Hi! I'm a fourth year Stats and Data Science major and English minor who's also pursuing a TMP certificate. When I'm not studying or doing data science-y things, I'm rowing crew for UCSB and working at CLAS. I hope to apply my knowledge of statistics and machine learning in either sports or business. |  Bio |  Bio |
