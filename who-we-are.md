Data Science at UCSB is the university's most active engineering and science club on campus. We focus on teaching students the basics of topics in data science such as data visualization, manipulation, predictive modeling, and machine learning. Focusing on R, Python, and SQL, we hope to foster a learning environment for students of all skill levels.

The club is open to students of all grade levels and majors.
