Data Science at UCSB is the university's most active engineering and science club on campus. We focus on teaching students the basics of topics in data science such as data visualization, manipulation, predictive modeling, and machine learning. Focusing on R, Python, and SQL, we hope to foster a learning environment for students of all skill levels.

The club is open to students of all grade levels and majors.

Hello! My name is Luke Fields. I am currently a 2nd-year Statistics and Data Science Major from Orange County, CA. I like to take in the Isla Vista beaches, as well as seize advantage of everything the beautiful SB area has to offer in my free time. I joined the Data Science club because I saw an opportunity to train my skills in data science in a way I could not do on my own, as well as in a way that would show me the highlights and potential of the data science community at UCSB! |  I am a third year majoring in Actuarial Science. I grew up in Southern California, and in my free time I enjoy mindlessly scrolling through Reddit and rewatching my favorite episodes of Community. I am passionate about deep learning and want to help others learn about what they are passionate about in this broad subject we call "Data Science."  | Fourth year, Statistic and Data Science, from Lanzhou, China; love playing league of legends. Joining Data Science club is one of the greatest things I have done in college. It not only gives me more chances to practice my data science skill but also meet a lot of friends who are also interested in Data Science field!   |
